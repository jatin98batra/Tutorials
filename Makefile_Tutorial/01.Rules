You know the basics.....

target:dependencies/prerequisites
    command


Few things:
------------

1.  The target can be any file 
2.  The dependency are the files or other target
3.  I guess the command can be any bash command 
4.  To specify a specific target use make <target>
5.  The make command will execute the first target only if the target is not specified.
